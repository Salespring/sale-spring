# Setting Up Salespring on GitHub

Since Replit's GitHub integration isn't available in your interface, here's how to manually create your GitHub repository:

## Method 1: Using Replit's File Copy (Recommended)

### Step 1: Prepare Your Files
Your project is ready with:
- ✅ Professional README.md
- ✅ Proper .gitignore 
- ✅ Clean project structure
- ✅ 472 source files organized

### Step 2: Create GitHub Repository
1. Go to [GitHub.com](https://github.com)
2. Click **"New repository"**
3. Repository name: `salespring`
4. Description: `AI-powered sales coaching platform with meeting notes and CRM sync`
5. Choose **Public** or **Private**
6. **Do NOT** check "Initialize with README" (you already have one)
7. Click **"Create repository"**

### Step 3: Copy Files to GitHub
Since bulk upload isn't ideal for 472 files, use this approach:

**Option A: Clone and Copy**
```bash
# On your local machine
git clone https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/salespring.git
# Copy all files from Replit to this folder (except node_modules)
git add .
git commit -m "Initial commit: Salespring AI sales coaching platform"
git push
```

**Option B: Use GitHub Desktop**
1. Install [GitHub Desktop](https://desktop.github.com)
2. Clone your empty repository
3. Copy project files into the local folder
4. Commit and push through the desktop app

### Step 4: Essential Files to Copy
Make sure to include these key files:
- `README.md` (project documentation)
- `package.json` (dependencies)
- `client/` folder (React frontend)
- `server/` folder (Express backend)
- `shared/` folder (shared schemas)
- `prisma/` folder (database schema)
- `.gitignore` (ignore rules)
- `tsconfig.json`, `vite.config.ts`, etc. (config files)

**DO NOT copy:**
- `node_modules/` (will be recreated with npm install)
- `.git/` (if present)
- Any `.env` files with secrets

## Method 2: Manual File Upload (For Smaller Sets)

For the core files, you can upload directly:
1. In your GitHub repo, click **"uploading an existing file"**
2. Upload key files in this order:
   - `README.md` first
   - `package.json`
   - Then folders: `client/`, `server/`, `shared/`, `prisma/`

## After Upload

1. **Add Environment Variables**: In GitHub repo → Settings → Secrets and variables → Actions
2. **Update README**: Edit if needed for GitHub-specific instructions
3. **Set up GitHub Actions**: Optional for CI/CD
4. **Enable GitHub Pages**: If you want to showcase the project

## Verify Setup
Your GitHub repository should show:
- Professional README with feature descriptions
- Proper folder structure
- All TypeScript/React source files
- Configuration files for easy setup

This will create a professional GitHub repository that showcases your Salespring project effectively!
